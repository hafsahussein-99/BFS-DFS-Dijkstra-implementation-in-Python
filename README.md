# BFS-DFS-Dijkstra-implementation-in-Python
Graph Traversal Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of three fundamental graph algorithms:

 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

 Depth-First Search (DFS)

 Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (for shortest paths in weighted graphs)

How to Run
These are plain .py files. You can run them using:
python bfs.py
python dfs.py
python dijkstra.py

This project was created for an academic assignment to:

Demonstrate understanding of graph traversal

Implement and explain each algorithm

Analyze complexity and applications
